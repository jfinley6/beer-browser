# Phase-1 Project Beer Browser

An app which allows users to browse from beers from an API called PunkAPI. Beers will be displayed in a grid that is divided up into multiple pages. Beers can be searched by ABV, IBU, and Name. Clicking any beer on the page will take you to a details page where you can favorite it. Clicking the favorites tab will take you to a list of all the favorites. The settings tab will allow you to change the header color as well as toggle light/dark mode. These settings will be saved into local storage.
